## üìò Project Overview:
You are assisting with the **integration of a dynamic, reusable process flow module** into an existing Laravel application. The app uses [Spatie Laravel Permissions](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v5/introduction) and dynamic route-based middleware (based on [this CodeAndDeploy tutorial](https://codeanddeploy.com/blog/laravel/how-to-create-a-custom-dynamic-middleware-for-spatie-laravel-permission)).

## üéØ Goal:
To implement a **model-agnostic dynamic process flow system** that supports tracking and managing step-based workflows across key models.

## üìå Key Requirements:

1. **Target Models**:
   - `PsipName`: Represents a public sector investment project.
   - `Activity`: Represents activities under each `PsipName`.

2. **Process Flow Behavior**:
   - Each `Activity` must have its own independent process flow.
   - Each `PsipName` may have a process flow (optional, but supported).
   - A `PsipName`‚Äôs process flow is marked as **complete automatically** only when **all related `Activity` items are completed**.
   - Future support for `SubActivity` or other models must be considered.

3. **Model-Agnostic Design**:
   - Use polymorphic relationships (`model_type`, `model_id`) in relevant tables to support any Eloquent model.

4. **Database Tables** (expected or to be created):
   - `process_flows`: Holds definition metadata and model association.
   - `process_steps`: Steps within a flow.
   - `process_conditions`: Logic that determines if a step can proceed.
   - `process_actions`: Actions triggered when steps complete.
   - `process_instances`: Tracks progress per model instance.
   - `process_logs`: Logs transitions and outcomes.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - A UI element (e.g. button) must be available to manually complete the current step.
   - Once clicked, the system automatically:
     - Checks conditions.
     - Executes actions.
     - Moves to the next step.
     - Optionally updates parent model flows if applicable (e.g., PsipName).

6. **Permissions**:
   - All flow-related routes must use Spatie‚Äôs dynamic middleware (`permission`) based on route names.
   - Ensure only authorized users can advance steps.

## üìé Future-Proofing:
- The system should be designed so that any future Eloquent model (like `SubActivity`) can plug into the same flow mechanism without new logic being written.

## üß™ Testing:
- Support both unit and feature tests for:
  - Advancing a step.
  - Completing flows.
  - Linking model states.
  - Permission-blocked access.

I am building a Laravel 10 application that uses Spatie Laravel Permissions and a dynamic middleware pattern based on this tutorial:
https://codeanddeploy.com/blog/laravel/how-to-create-a-custom-dynamic-middleware-for-spatie-laravel-permission

Now I want to build a dynamic, model-agnostic process flow system inside this application. The system should track workflows for Eloquent models. Here‚Äôs what I want:

1. The models `PsipName` and `Activity` must be able to have process flows.
2. `Activity` must always have its own process flow.
3. `PsipName` may have one, and its flow should be marked ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù automatically when all of its `Activity` items are completed.
4. The process flow must support other models in the future (e.g. `SubActivity`), so please design with polymorphic relationships in mind.
5. There must be a button (or UI placeholder) that allows users to manually complete a step and advance the process.
6. The flow must consist of: steps, conditions, actions, and logs.
7. Each process instance must be stored (per model), and every step must be loggable.
8. Use Spatie‚Äôs dynamic middleware (`permission`) to restrict advancing a step based on route name.

Let‚Äôs begin by designing the database schema and relationships. Please generate migrations for:
- process_flows
- process_steps
- process_conditions
- process_actions
- process_instances
- process_logs

Ensure these use polymorphic relationships to associate flows with any Eloquent model.
```
